This is a game based around Bruner. 
You will need to have a few tools:              
 * 1.) emacs (As an editor there is no better choice for lisp)               
 * 2.) SBCL                                                                 
 * 3.) slime                                                                 

This project is currently being headed up by Charlie Hicks.
We will be working on it as a group though.
